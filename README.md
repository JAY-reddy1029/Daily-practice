This repository contains my day-to-day practice and learning progress from the Full Stack Data Science course.
The goal is to build strong foundations in Python, SQL, Data Analysis, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Deployment, while keeping track of my progress in an organized way.

📂 Repository Structure
Each folder corresponds to a day or topic of practice.

Includes Jupyter Notebooks, Python scripts, SQL queries, and summary notes.

Larger, end-to-end projects are maintained in separate repositories.

🛠️ Topics Covered
Throughout this journey, I will be practicing and implementing:

Python Programming (Basics, OOP, Libraries)

Data Analysis (NumPy, Pandas, EDA)

Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Power BI/Tableau)

SQL (Queries, Joins, Subqueries, Optimization)

Machine Learning (Regression, Classification, Clustering, Feature Engineering)

Deep Learning (ANN, CNN, RNN, Transfer Learning)

NLP (Text Processing, Transformers)

MLOps & Deployment (Flask, FastAPI, Docker, Cloud)

Statistics & Mathematics for Data Science

📌 Note
👉 This repository is focused on daily practice and consistency tracking.
